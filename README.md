Hello World!/Â¡Hola Mundo!,

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning JavaScript.  I am looking for a deep base of knowledge in coding.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS.
- . . I love the Spanish language and use it daily.  I also love the Latino community and enjoy spending time with them.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything JavaScript!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my decades as a Certified Person Trainer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: CodingRules66@gmail.com.  Please be patient as I only look at my email once, maybe twice a day.  No more.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm too old for this shite!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I live to read. I enjoy every moment that I get to learn or speak Spanish.  I would love to live for a time in South America.  My heart feels like it belongs there.  Now to that I can add Coding as it really does Rule!  I love the process of learning this new language.  It's different than Spanish but I really enjoy figuring out how to make things do my bidding!  Seriously, I have seriously been loving this journey.  It fascinates me.
As Albert Einstein said - "I have no special talent, I am only passionately curious."  That pretty much sums me up.
